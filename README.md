# Unscented Kalman Filter Project

## Self-Driving Engineer Nanodegree Term 2, Project 2

**The aim of the project is to implement an unscented Kalman filter using the CTRV motion model.**

The model is implemented in C++. Find the source code in [src](https://github.com/toluwajosh/CarND-UKF-Project/tree/master/src) and find the result analyses in [ukf-visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/toluwajosh/CarND-UKF-Project/blob/master/data_analysis/ukf-visualization.ipynb)

Below are original instructions:

## Dependencies

* cmake >= v3.5
* make >= v4.1
* gcc/g++ >= v5.4

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./UnscentedKF path/to/input.txt path/to/output.txt`. You can find
   some sample inputs in 'data/'.
    - eg. `./UnscentedKF ../data/sample-laser-radar-measurement-data-1.txt output.txt`

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) as much as possible.

## Generating Additional Data

This is optional!

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.
